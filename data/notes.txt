-Make a dropdown when the user is typing the name of a fighter that will filter the results of a fetch to the getAllFighters endpoint
-This will give them a list of fighters to select from.

-It will be filled with the id rather than searching for the first and last name from the fighters object. 
-This fighters object will be the body of the endpoint request
